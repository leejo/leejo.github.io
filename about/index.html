<strong>About Me</strong>
<p>
	I would call myself a "perl developer" as this has been my primary role for over a decade.

	I would not really call myself a photographer because i do not have a body of work.
	I am currently working on a few short term projects and a couple of longer ones that may change this.
	The intention of this website is primarily for the photography projects.
</p>

<p>
	The secondary intention of this website is as a sporadic blogging platform.
	There are no comments enabled on the blog entries, if you want to get in touch do so using the links below.

<p>
	Originally from the United Kingdom, i am currently living in Switzerland.
