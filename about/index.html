<p>
I would call myself a software developer as this has been my primary role for almost two decades. I am the maintainer / author of several modules on <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/LEEJO">CPAN</a> and a sporadic attendee / <a href="/code">speaker</a> at various conferences.
</p>
<p>
	I have been a contributing photographer to several print and online magazines in the past and am now working on a few long term photographic projects.
</p>

<p>
	The main intention of this website is the <a href="/">photography projects</a>.
	The secondary intention of this website is as an occasional <a href="/blog">blogging platform</a>.
	There are no comments enabled on the blog entries, if you want to get in touch do so using the links below.
</p>

<p>
	Originally from the United Kingdom, i am currently living in Switzerland.
