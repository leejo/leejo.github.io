<p>
	I would call myself a "perl developer" as this has been my primary role for over a decade. I am the maintainer / author of several perl modules on <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/LEEJO">CPAN</a> and a sporadic attendee / speaker at various perl conferences.
</p>
<p>
	I have been a contributing photographer to several print and online magazines in the past and am now working on a few long term photographic projects.
</p>

<p>
	The main intention of this website is the photography projects.
	The secondary intention of this website is as an occasional blogging platform.
	There are no comments enabled on the blog entries, if you want to get in touch do so using the links below.
