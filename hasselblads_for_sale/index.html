<p>

<p>
	I am located in Switzerland and visit the UK usually once a year. You can contact me via the various methods found on my <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/about">about page</a> (email preferred).
</p>

<h3 id="detail">Detail</h3>

<p>
	I have been using Hasselblad equipment since 2007 when I purchased a 201F. I upgraded to the 203FE listed here in 2011. I purchased the 202FA as a backup body in 2014. The 907x + CFVII 50c was purchased in late 2020 as I wanted to use the digital back with the 203FE and 202FA bodies.
</p>

<p>
	I have shot several long term projects with the equipment, including a <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/">Decade long project on Formula 1</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/switzerland-bergbahnen">Swiss ski lifts</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/switzerland-villars-vanguard"> The local jazz club</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/lost-in-shinjuku">A night in Shinjuku</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/green-blue-grey">A US road trip</a>, and <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/skateboarding">Skateboarding</a>.
</p>

<p> 
	As well as those I have put a few hundred rolls of film through the cameras on other non-project work. They have been workhorses, but all the equipment has remained in excellent condition and has been serviced regularly.
</p>

<p>
	I am no longer interested in shooting medium format, and the purchase of the 907x + CFV II 50c has confirmed that. I primarily shoot panoramic (XPan) and large format (4x5) work these days and the medium format kit is now rarely used. I don't see myself shooting any more project work with it.
</p>

<p>
	Therefore I am selling all of it. I am selling the three kits each as a whole - I will not sell individual components. I am listing them at a little below current market rates, taking into consideration their condition and service history.
</p>

<p>
	I am based in Switzerland, and travel to the UK usually once a year. I would prefer to sell this in person rather than shipping but am open to do that if necessary. I have a 20+ year 100% positive feedback rating on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/fdbk/feedback_profile/the-amos-last-alchemist">eBay</a>. You can contact me via the various methods found on my <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/about">about page</a>. I'm happy to provide more photos or even videos of any of the equipment.

<h3 id="203">203FE + 110mm f2 FE + E12</h3>

<div class="img-centre">
	<img width="650px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hasselblads_for_sale/203fe/DSCF9305.JPG" />
	<div class="nav_text">203FE</div>
</div>

<p>
	The 203FE is the best camera Hasselblad ever made. Fully automatic exposure on a 6x6 medium format frame with a focal plane shutter allowing up to 1/2000. It is compatible with all the C/CF/CFi/CFE/F/FE lenses.
</p>

<p>
	The meter is incredibly accurate and will expose in automatic mode at 1/12th of a stop precision, and works in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions. I have exposed in the region of 5,000 frames and it has never made a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	The camera body is a 2002 model, a late production one, and has been serviced twice while I have owned it. The most recent service was mid 2021 and included a full CLA as well as replacement of a couple of parts - this cost me €830. The receipt for this service can be provided.
</p>

<p>
	As you can see from the pictures this would probably be described as in excellent condition - it has some minor cosmetic marks but is mechanically and electrically perfect. Most camera stores, with their overly generous ratings systems, would probably rate this closer to near mint. This one having a recent service and regular use is probably in better condition than those marked "as new" or "unused", as these cameras need regular use to ensure they keep working.
</p>

<p>
	The body comes with a WLF (waist level finder) with a normal (0) diopter, and a Acute Matte D grided screen with split prism - the best screen you can get to ensure spot on focus. An E12 back is also included along with a fresh set of light seals (these are trivial to replace).

</div>

<br />

<p>
	203FE cameras in this condition are now selling in the region of €6,000 with an 80mm lens. However I am including the 110mm f2 FE lens with this one, which alone is now selling for €3,000.
</p>

<p>
	The version of the 110mm lens I am selling is also a late model - known as the fifth generation. It is the FE version for full electronic compatibility with the body. I also asked for this lens to be serviced but Hasselblad said it was in perfect condition and thus did not need any work. The lens also includes a hood.
</p>

<p>
	The lens includes its original box and both caps. The camera includes the original manual and body cap. You can find out more about 200 series Hasselblad cameras and lenses <a href="http://photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/Hasselblad200.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Price</b> - I am looking for <b>€6,500</b> for this setup. That factors in the cost of the body, back, and finder + screen, along with the sought after fifth generation 110mm f2 FE lens and the very recent service of the equipment. Looking at current asking prices this is a saving of around €2,000.
<p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="202">202FA + 80mm CFE + E12</h3>

<div class="img-centre">
	<img width="650px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hasselblads_for_sale/202fa/DSCF9325.JPG" />
	<div class="nav_text">202FA</div>
</div>

<p>
	The 202FA was the "budget" version of the 200 series bodies. It still features fully automatic exposure on a 6x6 medium format frame with a focal plane shutter allowing up to 1/1000. It is compatible with all the CF/CFi/CFE/F/FE lenses. The difference between this one and the 203FE is that the 202FA doesn't have a manual mode and you can't use the shutter in the lenses, so it is less compatible with existing equipment.
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion it's still just as good as the 203FE, because if you have one of these cameras you don't use it in manual mode - you use it in aperture priority and rely on the 1/12th stop accurate exposures. As with my 203FE this camera has never made a bad exposure.
</p>

<p>
	I purchased this camera in 2014 as a second body for my main <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/">project at the time</a>. The two reasons were to 1) have a backup camera, and 2) have another focal length without having to change lenses. I ended up shooting a significant percentage of the project on this camera. The camera was serviced by Hasselblad in 2014 shortly after I purchased it, they replaced the shutter mechanism in the process. The receipt for this service can be provided.
</p>

<p>
	The body is a 1998 model, the lens is an 80mm f2.8 CFE from 2002 - this is fully compatible with the electronic functions of the 202FA body to allow automatic exposure. These lenses are now quite sought after, usually selling for above €1,500 on the used market. The lens includes both caps, hood, and original box.
</p>

<p>
	The body comes with a WLF (waist level finder) with a normal (0) diopter, and a Beattie Intenscreen with split prism - the best screen you can get to ensure spot on focus. An E12 back is also included with a fresh set of light seals (these are trivial to replace), the E12 back was serviced in 2016. Again, the receipt for this service can be provided.

</div>

<br />

<p>
	As with the 203FE - the condition of all this equipment is excellent, with a recent service history and regular use to keep it in working condition. The cosmetic condition of this camera is closer to near mint as you can see from the pictures.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Price</b> - I am looking for <b>€3,500</b> for this setup. That factors in the cost of the body, back, and finder + screen, along with the sought after 80mm f2.8 CFE lens and the recent service of the equipment. Looking at current asking prices this is a saving of around €1,500. Of note is that the 202FA is actually a much harder camera to find on the used market.

<h3 id="907">907x/CFV 50c II (2020) + XCD 4/45P</h3>

<div class="img-centre">
	<img width="650px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hasselblads_for_sale/907x/DSCF9321.JPG" />
	<div class="nav_text">907x + CFV II 50c</div>
</div>

<p>
	I probably don't need to tell you much about this one - I purchsed it new in late 2020 so I could use the digital back with the aforementioned camera bodies. I've used it very little, the file counter reads less than 2,000 for the back and less than 500 for the lens.
</p>

<p>
	I've made large prints from this setup, and have made prints from combining it with the 200 series bodies, Xpan lenses, and my large format camera. Its flexibility is what makes it the most compelling if you have existing equipment to use it with. As a standalone camera it's OK. I wrote an extensive blog post about this setup <a href="https://leejo.github.io/2021/05/31/hasselblad_reality/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The entire setup is in mint condition with the exception of the buttons on the back - there is a known problem with these buttons that the black covering rubs away as you use them. It's purely cosmetic and Hasselblad <i>will</i> replace them if you want, I just haven't bothered. The sensor of the back is in perfect condition.
</p>

</div>

<br />

<p>
	Also included is an extra battery and two SD cards. All equipment is in the original boxes, which are also in mint condition. As I bought all this equipment new receipts for the original purchase(s) can be provided.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Price</b> - I am looking for <b>€6,000</b> for this setup. That factors in that this is a very recent camera that has been little used and that it includes the XCD 4/45P lens. If you wanted to buy this setup new it would cost €8,000 so here you are saving €2,000.
<p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="more">Additional Equipment</h3>

<p>
	I also have the following items. Note that I will only be selling these if the individual setups above go to different owners, as I plan to include them at no extra cost if someone buys all three setups. I shall add prices when that's clearer. If you are interested in a single setup above and want to also take one or more of the items below let me know and we can agree a price. All the equipment is working and excellent, pictures available if required.
</p>

<p><b>Acute Matte D Screen CFV 50</b> - This is a screen for V bodies that is of the Acute Matte D type, with split prism, but also features crop guidelines for when you use the digital back with the camera. These are now hard to get as Hasselblad don't include it with the 907x setup, you have to purchase them as an extra.</p>

<p><b>907x XPan Lens Adaptor</b> - Allows you to use XPan lenses with the 907x.</p>

<p><b>150mm f2.8 FE</b> - Probably Hasselblad's most slept on lens. I actually think it's <i>better</i> than the 110mm f2. One of Hasselblad's sharpest lenses (and yes, <a href="https://www.photo.net/discuss/threads/sonnar-fe-150-lens-qualitiy-and-converter-2xe.13508/">it is tack sharp wide open</a>).</p>

<p><b>PM45 Prism</b> - 45 degree non-metered prism for V bodies. Also shows you the image flipped, which ends up being the correct orientation for the final exposure.</p>

<p><b>D-Flash 40</b> - Dedicated flash unit for Hasselblad V bodies. You can get TTL automatic exposure if you use this with the 203FE/202FA (and other V bodies).</p>

<p><b>WLF -1 Diopter</b> - A -1 diopter for the waist level finder. I have this as when I purchased the 202FA it had it, so I replaced it with a neutral diopter.</p>

<p><b>V Body Tripod Quick Mount</b> - A quick release for V bodies. You attach this to the tripod head and you can then quickly and easily slide your V body in and out without having to faff about with the screw mounts.</p>
