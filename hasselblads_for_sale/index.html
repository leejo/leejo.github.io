</div>

<p>
	<b>TL;DR</b>: I'm selling most of my Hasselblad medium format equipment. This includes two complete setups. Please note I am only selling each setup as a whole and will not separate parts. For details and a full breakdown and history, with pictures, click on the links:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#202">202FA</a> + 80mm f2.8 CFE + E12</li>
		<li><a href="#907">907x/CFV 50c II</a></li>
	</ul>
<p>

<p>
	In other words - A high spec 200 series body film camera, with the recently released 907x/CFVII 50c to allow it to be used in a digital capacity. Please note, and I repeat myself, <b>I will not separate individual items</b> - i.e. I won't sell the 202FE body alone, nor the 80mm f2.8 CFE alone, etc. So please don't ask.
</p>

<p>
	The price is <b>â‚¬8,000</b> if you want to buy both setups together. Apart they're a little more. Read on for details.
</p>

<p>
	I am located in Switzerland and visit the UK usually once a year. You can contact me via the various methods found on my <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/about">about page</a> (email preferred).
</p>

<h3 id="detail">Detail</h3>

<p>
	I have been using Hasselblad equipment since 2007 when I purchased a 201F. I upgraded to the 203FE listed here in 2011. I purchased the 202FA as a backup body in 2014. The 907x + CFVII 50c was purchased in late 2020 as I wanted to use the digital back with the 203FE and 202FA bodies.
</p>

<p>
	I have shot several long term projects with the equipment, including a <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/">Decade long project on Formula 1</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/switzerland-bergbahnen">Swiss ski lifts</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/switzerland-villars-vanguard"> The local jazz club</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/lost-in-shinjuku">A night in Shinjuku</a>, <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/green-blue-grey">A US road trip</a>, and <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/skateboarding">Skateboarding</a>.
</p>

<p>2
	As well as those I have put a few hundred rolls of film through the cameras on other non-project work. They have been workhorses, but all the equipment has remained in excellent condition and has been serviced regularly.
</p>

<p>
	I am no longer interested in shooting medium format, and the purchase of the 907x + CFV II 50c has confirmed that. I primarily shoot panoramic (XPan) and large format (4x5) work these days and the medium format kit is now rarely used. I don't see myself shooting any more project work with it. Therefore I am selling most of it. I am listing them at a little below current market rates, taking into consideration their condition and service history.
</p>

<p>
	I am based in Switzerland, and travel to the UK usually once a year. I would prefer to sell this in person rather than shipping but am open to do that if necessary. I have a 20+ year 100% positive feedback rating on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/fdbk/feedback_profile/the-amos-last-alchemist">eBay</a>. You can contact me via the various methods found on my <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/about">about page</a>. I'm happy to provide more photos or even videos of any of the equipment.

<h3 id="202">202FA (+ 80mm f2.8 CFE + E12)</h3>

<div class="img-centre">
	<img width="650px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hasselblads_for_sale/202fa/DSCF9325.JPG" />
	<div class="nav_text">202FA</div>
</div>

<p>
	The 202FA was the "budget" version of the 200 series bodies. It still features fully automatic exposure on a 6x6 medium format frame with a focal plane shutter allowing up to 1/1000. It is compatible with all the CF/CFi/CFE/F/FE lenses. The difference between this one and the 203FE is that the 202FA can't use the shutter in the lenses (although those lenses can be used with the focal plane shutter in the body) so it is less compelling to photographers who require flash.
</p>

<p>
	Much like the 203FE, the meter is incredibly accurate and will expose in automatic mode at 1/12th of a stop precision, and works in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions. I have exposed in the region of 5,000 frames and it has never made a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion it's still just as good as the 203FE. As with my 203FE this camera has never made a bad exposure. The body is a 1998 model.
</p>

<p>
	I purchased this camera in 2014 as a second body for my main <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/">project at the time</a>. The two reasons were to 1) have a backup camera, and 2) have another focal length without having to change lenses. I ended up shooting a significant percentage of the project on this camera. The camera was serviced by Hasselblad in 2014 shortly after I purchased it, they replaced the shutter mechanism in the process. The receipt for this service can be provided.
</p>

<p>
	The body comes with a WLF (waist level finder) with a normal (0) diopter, and a Beattie Intenscreen with split prism - the best screen you can get to ensure spot on focus. An E12 back is also included with a fresh set of light seals (these are trivial to replace), the E12 back was serviced in 2016. Again, the receipt for this service can be provided.
</p>

<p>
	I'm selling this with the 80mm f2.8 CFE lens pictured above, the lens is in mint condition with original caps and box.

<br />

<p>
	As with the 203FE - the condition of all this equipment is excellent, with a recent service history and regular use to keep it in working condition. The cosmetic condition of this camera is closer to near mint as you can see from the pictures.

<h3 id="907">907x/CFV 50c II (2020)</h3>

<div class="img-centre">
	<img width="650px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/hasselblads_for_sale/907x/DSCF9321.JPG" />
	<div class="nav_text">907x + CFV II 50c</div>
</div>

<p>
	I probably don't need to tell you much about this one - I purchsed it new in late 2020 so I could use the digital back with the aforementioned camera bodies. I've used it very little, the file counter reads less than 2,000 for the back and less than 500 for the lens.
</p>

<p>
	I've made large prints from this setup, and have made prints from combining it with the 200 series bodies, Xpan lenses, and my large format camera. Its flexibility is what makes it the most compelling if you have existing equipment to use it with. As a standalone camera it's OK. I wrote an extensive blog post about this setup <a href="https://leejo.github.io/2021/05/31/hasselblad_reality/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The entire setup is in mint condition with the exception of the buttons on the back - there is a known problem with these buttons that the black covering rubs away as you use them. It's purely cosmetic and Hasselblad <i>will</i> replace them if you want, I just haven't bothered. The sensor of the back is in perfect condition.

<br />

<p>
	Also included is an extra battery and two SD cards. All equipment is in the original boxes, which are also in mint condition. As I bought all this equipment new receipts for the original purchase(s) can be provided.
