I have just received a copy of my photobook [The Green The Blue The Grey](/projects/the_green_the_blue_the_grey/) and am super happy with how it has come out. Many thanks to [Ben](http://benjaminbostock.com/) and [Team](http://www.team-impression.com/) for their help with putting the book together.

I won't be back in the UK until the 20th December, but have made the book available to order in advance. I will endeavour to ship them the moment i am back in the UK. Limited to 50 copies so be quick!
