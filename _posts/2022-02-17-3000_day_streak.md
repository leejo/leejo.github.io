I'm <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/53071759762731317158919307355131715382112054804279723112583938899370898882561">selling my 3,000 day Duolingo streak as an NFT</a>. Why? Why the fuck not, that's why. A 3,000 day streak puts me in the <a href="https://duome.eu/#leejebay">top #250 on Duolingo</a>. That's in the top <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/duolingo-statistics/">0.00005% of users</a>

I reached my 3,000 day streak on the date of this blog post: 17th February 2022. That means I started the streak on 1st December 2013. That's over eight years of daily Duolingo, maintained across time zones, countries, illness, internet outage, device loss, and other potential streak jeopardising events. Eight years.

Eight years predates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Launch_and_the_DAO_event_(2014%E2%80%932016)">Ethereum blockchain</a> by two years. It predates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token#Early_history_(2014%E2%80%932017)">first known NFT</a> by six months. It's eight years of self improvement, representing anything from five to thirty minutes per day. Every. Single. Day. That's a total time spent of at least 250 hours.

And you know what, that 250 hours probably represents more effort than has been put into creating most of the things currently being sold as NFTs *combined*. The CryptoPunks, the Bored Apes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g&t=3492s">all that lowest common denominator minimal effort wash traded manipulated market shite</a>.

**No Fucking Thanks**

NFTs make me uneasy. Not just in all the ways that should be obvious to anyone who isn't invested in the pyramid, but in the way they are convincing an otherwise intelligent and technically savy group of people that they can make massive returns on practically zero effort.

It's much like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc, convinced another group of people that they can become mega famous and thus reap the rewards if they just use the right hashtags, or just grow their follower count enough, or just get featured in the right places to go viral.

NFTs also make me uneasy as an artist in the <a href="https://www.galeriealpine.com/lee-johnson">physical space</a>. One who has trawled the photo festivals and portfolio reviews to find a break, consumed countless hours submitting to calls for work only to hear the same old responses, spent a decade on a <a href="https://www.formulanon.com/">single project</a> and is now dealing with the seemingly abyss like submission process when contacting publishers.

NFTs also make me uneasy as a software engineer, one who works for a company that builds <a href="https://www.givengain.com/">tools</a> that create a net positive impact. Much like Duolingo. Maybe that means my NFT is somewhat of a contradiction given the entire infrastructure built upon around all this stuff seems immensely wasteful.

I've always said that the idea of software engineering is pretty simple: creating value by moving useful data around. NFTs, and by association cryptocurrencies, have taken that idea to the extreme. Consuming massive amounts of energy to create as much value as possible from <a href="https://blog.geeveedeevee.com/2021/03/what-non-funigble-token.html">largely pointless data</a>.
