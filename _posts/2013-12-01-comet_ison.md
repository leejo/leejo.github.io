Possibly? Maybe? Maybe not? As seen 1st December 2013 15:40 UTC. Approx 230 degrees WSW from the Swiss Alps, not sure about the height in the sky but it has to be less than 10 degrees. Visible for around 30m+. If you want to use this image or want the full size version please contact me. Click [here]({{ site.url }}/images/ison_crop.jpg) for a closer crop.
